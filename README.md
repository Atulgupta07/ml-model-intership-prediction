# ml-model-intership-prediction
 This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline for solving binary classification problems using popular algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The focus is on careful data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
