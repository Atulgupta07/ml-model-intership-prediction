# ml-model-intership-prediction
 This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline for solving binary classification problems using popular algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). The focus is on careful data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

 üìà Week 1: Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
Overview
In the first week, we focused on cleaning the raw dataset to ensure it was suitable for further analysis. Key tasks included handling missing values, removing duplicates, correcting formatting issues, and standardizing data types. Feature engineering techniques were also applied to extract meaningful insights from existing data columns.

Key Steps
Data Cleaning:
Addressed missing values using imputation techniques.
Removed unnecessary columns and standardized data types.
Validated entries for accuracy, including dates, numerical fields, and categorical data.
Feature Engineering:
Created new features such as "Age of Learner," "Engagement Duration," and "Time Since Last Engagement."
Implemented one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
Normalized engagement-related metrics to prepare for modeling.
Tools & Libraries
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
Jupyter Notebook
üîç Week 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Overview
In the second week, we conducted an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights within the cleaned dataset. This phase laid the foundation for hypothesis generation and feature selection for predictive modeling.

Key Analyses
Demographic Insights:
Analyzed learner demographics like age, gender, and engagement patterns.
Identified high engagement among specific age groups (18-28 years).
Temporal Trends:
Seasonal analysis of engagement scores, sign-up trends, and engagement duration.
Observed peak engagement in specific months (e.g., July) and days (e.g., Thursday).
Advanced Visualizations:
Generated correlation heatmaps, PCA plots, and clustering (K-Means) to identify underlying data structures.
Conducted cohort analysis to track engagement over time.
Tools & Libraries
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)

üìä Week 3: Churn Analysis & Predictive Modeling
Overview
The focus of week three was to develop a robust predictive model for identifying students at risk of churn. The analysis aimed to uncover factors contributing to student drop-offs and to build a model capable of predicting churn with high accuracy.

Key Steps
Data Preparation:
Created new engagement metrics and defined churn indicators based on engagement duration, frequency, and inactivity.
Labeled students as "churned" or "non-churned" based on thresholds derived from EDA insights.
Model Training:
Trained multiple models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Autoencoder, and Multilayer perceptron.
In the trial method, before implementation, we achieved the best results with an ensemble Voting Classifier, yielding 98% accuracy.
Model Evaluation:
Evaluated models using metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Confusion Matrix.
The ANN model demonstrated high predictive power for complex engagement patterns.
